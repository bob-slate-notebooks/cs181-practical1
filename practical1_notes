neural network
- adaptive basis function regression
- for linear, we had a phi that we multiplied with w, then find gradient 
- instead of just one phi, 
scikitlearn
pandas
numpy

cross validation - divide up training data and set lambda

higher alpha - regularization parameter - more of your weights are gonna be zero
lambda is the same thing as alpha


>>> import sklearn
>>> from sklearn import linear_model
>>> linear_model.Ridge

>>> x = linear_model.Ridge(alpha = 0.5)
